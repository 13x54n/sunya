# Sunya - Goto for Starknet Interaction

### TLDR; If you miss this story, you miss the fun! 🤧

First off, we are trying to build a community over starknet. We allow users interact to starknet with seamless experience and onboarding. How are we doing that?

- **🫀 Non-Tech Users**: "Habits don't happen if it was hard to do!", we enable **Gas Tank** aka meta transaction happen for seamless writing to blockchain for regular users. They just use another app in forms of dApp but more secured, seamless, and transparent.
- **☕ Developers**: We are trying connect L1 & L2 with tools:
  - **Compilation & Static Analysis:** Before you deploy to mainnet and you don't want to pay high security audit 💵? Least you can do is perform static analysis and we enable developers in our platform.
  - **Deployment**: 👀 As we are trying to onboard users into Starknet, we currently enable L2 deployments only enabling meta-transactions.
  - **Verification**: For Developers you can get that ✅ verifying the contract ownership(P.S. DID) but you don't have to leave our platform to achieve that, you don't have to search internet, that's boring! 😪

**Target Partners:**

- ☁️ Voyager API for interacting with Starknet listening to events that happens on-chain.
- 👛 ArgentX for seamless authentication to our dApp enabling web-wallet, login using phone (P.S. you don't need another extension).
- 🔗 Dynamic SDK for cross-chain smart contract audits verification, writing for DID, you heard right its Decentralized Identity.
- 📜 Herodotus API for interacting with L1 Security Audits from L2, well sorry we'll soon add data proofing from Bitcoin too.
- 📊 Dashboard visualization using datasets from Token Flow Studio for web-based access.

### Getting Started

Get your coffee(☕) first time installation might take some minutes.

- `git clone https://github.com/13x54n/sunya.git`
- `cd sunya`
- `npm install || yarn install || bun install`: We use Bun.js for our local development but it should work on Node.js environment.

Well, now this can take some moment cause if requirement are not met we try to build and fix it so you don't have to. 🫠

- **Windows**: `cmd ./scripts/install.bat`
- **Linux & Unix**: `./scripts/install.sh`

- `{package manager} run dev` where `package manager ⊆ [npm, yarn, bun]`

🦄 Voila, you should see the demo of our project.

### 🛸 Note: This project is still on rapid development and might make you bleed cause it's edge!
