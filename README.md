# Sunya - Goto for Starknet Interaction
Here's our complete [documentation](https://lexy-team.gitbook.io/sunya/).

### TLDR; If you miss this story, you miss the fun! 🤧

First off, we are trying to build a community over starknet. We allow users interact to starknet with seamless experience and onboarding. How are we doing that?

- Non-Tech Users: "Habits don't happen if it was hard to do!", we enable Gas Tank ⛽ They just use another app in forms of dApp but more secured, seamless, and transparent. Aka meta transaction happen for seamless writing to blockchain for regular users. <br/>
Gas Tank ⛽ is powered by ArgentX & Dynamic Wallet that that deals with multi signature transactions and our features.
- Developers: We are trying connect L1 & L2 with tools:
- Compilation & Static Analysis: Before you deploy to mainnet and you don't know about security, don't want to pay high security audit? <br/>
Least you can do is perform static analysis and we enable developers in our platform. Soon, we'll start doing manual human audits.
- Deployment: As we are trying to onboard users into Starknet, we are trying to enable both L1 & L2 deployments enabling meta-transactions.
- Verification: For Developers you can get that ✅ on the contract verifying ownership(P.S. DID like AuditRegistry) but you don't have to leave our platform to achieve that, you don't have to search internet, that's boring! 😪
- Dashboard: Utilizing Voyager (Blockchain Data from Starknet), Etherscan (Blockchain Data from Ethereum), Herodotus (Provides storage proof for Registered Audit across multiple chain), Tokenflow (Querying transactions and events using queries made easier).

### Getting Started

Get your coffee(☕) first time installation might take some minutes.

- `git clone https://github.com/13x54n/sunya.git`
- `cd sunya`
- `npm install || yarn install || bun install`: We use Bun.js for our local development but it should work on Node.js environment.

Well, now this can take some moment cause if requirement are not met we try to build and fix it so you don't have to. 🫠

- **Windows**: `cmd ./scripts/install.bat`
- **Linux & Unix**: `./scripts/install.sh`

- `{package manager} run dev` where `package manager ⊆ [npm, yarn, bun]`

🦄 Voila, you should see the demo of our project.

### 🛸 Note: This project is still on rapid development and might make you bleed cause it's edge!
